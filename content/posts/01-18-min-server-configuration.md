# 18 min per Day
What are the Rules? Every Day - 18 minutes - for one year.

Let's see how far this can get. In the meantime I will try to write about what I've learned. 

Either just small updates or more content for topics I find interesting.

## Server configuration
I have two big books about server configuration. One is for linux and one for Windows. I will start with the linux book.

The idea is to read the book, think about it and try to make it useful.

If there are any ideas on small projects, I will let you know here.
