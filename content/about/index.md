Hi, my name is xander and I like cyber security, software development and servers.

Currenlty I'm studying [Bachelor Cyber Security](https://www.iu.de/en/bachelor/cyber-security/) at the [IU International University of Applied Sciences](https://www.iu.de/en/).

In my free time I like to bring interesting ideas to life, which mostly are never finished :D

On the way to finish these projects I will at least write about them in this blog.

Have fun!
