Hi, my name is xander and I like cyber security, software development and servers.

Currenlty I'm studying [Bachelor Cyber Security](https://www.iu.de/en/bachelor/cyber-security/) at the [IU International University of Applied Sciences](https://www.iu.de/en/).

In my free time I like to bring interesting ideas to life, play around with tech learning new things.

This page is basically my notes. Some notes are really just notes, some will be blog posts
and some will be collections of links.

If you find the notes interesting, leave me a comment and I can write more about the
notes or transform it to a blog post.

Have fun!
